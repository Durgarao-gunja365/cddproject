🛠️ CI/CD Pipeline Setup
This project uses Jenkins for continuous integration and Docker for containerization.

🔄 Workflow:
Jenkins Pipeline:

Configured via a Jenkinsfile stored in the root of the repository.

Automatically triggers on new commits to the main branch.

Steps Performed:

Clones the GitHub repository.

Builds a Docker image using the Dockerfile.

Installs dependencies from requirements.txt.

Pushes the Docker image to Docker Hub (if login is successful).

Cleans up the workspace after build.

Docker Integration:

Uses Python 3.9-slim base image.

Application code is copied into the container.

Required packages are installed inside the container.

✅ Build Status
Jenkins will show whether the build passed or failed directly on your Jenkins dashboard.


🚀 CI/CD with Jenkins and Docker — Step-by-Step Commands
🧰 Prerequisites
Jenkins installed and running

Docker installed and running

GitHub repo configured with Dockerfile, requirements.txt, and Jenkinsfile

Docker Hub account (for pushing images)

🔧 Step-by-Step Commands
1. Clone your repository (if needed):
bash
git clone https://github.com/Durgarao-gunja365/cddproject.git
cd cddproject
2. Start Jenkins and open the Jenkins dashboard:
bash
sudo systemctl start jenkins
Go to http://localhost:8080 or your Jenkins server IP

3. Create a New Jenkins Pipeline Job:
Click on "New Item".

Name it (e.g., cddproject).

Select "Pipeline" and click OK.

Scroll down to Pipeline script from SCM.

Select Git and enter your repository URL:
https://github.com/Durgarao-gunja365/cddproject.git

Click Save.

4. Run the Pipeline Job:
Click "Build Now"

Jenkins will:

Clone the repo

Build Docker image using Dockerfile

Install dependencies

(Optionally) push image to Docker Hub

5. Docker Commands (manually if needed):
📦 Build the Docker Image:
bash
docker build -t durgarao365/cddproject .
🔍 Check Docker Images:
bash
docker images
▶️ Run the Docker Container:
bash
docker run -p 5000:5000 durgarao365/cddproject
You can now access the app at http://localhost:5000

6. Login to Docker Hub (for pushing):
bash
docker login
7. Push Docker Image to Docker Hub:
bash
docker tag durgarao365/cddproject durgarao365/cddproject:latest
docker push durgarao365/cddproject:latest
